# Example

This directory directory contains a simple example application created with the cobra command.

```
cobra init
conra add hello
cobra add goodbye
```

I then added the code in docutil to create a little utility that generates
the documentation for the example application.  This utility uses the CreateDocGenCmdLineTool
and related functions to a create a command-line tool for generating does just for this 
example application.
